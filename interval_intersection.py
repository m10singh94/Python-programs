# Implement the function interval_intersection below.
# You can define other functions if it helps you decompose and solve
# the problem.
# Do not import any module that you do not use!

# Remember that if this were an exam problem, in order to be marked
# this file must meet certain requirements:
# - it must contain ONLY syntactically valid python code (any syntax
#   or indentation error that stops the file from running would result
#   in a mark of zero);
# - you MAY NOT use global variables; the function must use only the
#   input provided to it in its arguments.
